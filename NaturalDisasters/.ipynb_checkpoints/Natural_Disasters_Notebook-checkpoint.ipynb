The hurricane also knocked out the entire power grid, triggering a near total island blackout. The lack of aid after the disaster caused a humanitarian crisis, the worst in the US since Hurricane Katrina, which lasted several months and had a dramatic effect on Puerto Rico's population. Maria is the third costliest hurricane in history, behind only Katrina and Harvey.\n",

The Florida Keys were hit the hardest, with the vast majority of infrastructure there receiving some degree of damage, and at least 25% receiving major damage. Hurricane Irma also knocked out power to 73.33% of the state, or 7.7 million homes and businesses. Irma is the fifth costliest hurricane of all time.\n",

Most of the damage from Harvey occurred after it had weakened, due to extreme prolonged rains dropping several feet of water that triggered unprecedented floods in a large swath of Southeastern Texas, with the worst of the flooding occurring in Houston. Hurricane Harvey is widely considered to be the worst flooding disaster in the United States since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which it tied with as the costliest hurricane in history.\n",

The hurricane also knocked out the entire power grid, triggering a near total island blackout. The lack of aid after the disaster caused a humanitarian crisis, the worst in the US since Hurricane Katrina, which lasted several months and had a dramatic effect on Puerto Rico's population. Maria is the third costliest hurricane in history, behind only Katrina and Harvey.\n",

The Florida Keys were hit the hardest, with the vast majority of infrastructure there receiving some degree of damage, and at least 25% receiving major damage. Hurricane Irma also knocked out power to 73.33% of the state, or 7.7 million homes and businesses. Irma is the fifth costliest hurricane of all time.\n",

Most of the damage from Harvey occurred after it had weakened, due to extreme prolonged rains dropping several feet of water that triggered unprecedented floods in a large swath of Southeastern Texas, with the worst of the flooding occurring in Houston. Hurricane Harvey is widely considered to be the worst flooding disaster in the United States since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which it tied with as the costliest hurricane in history.\n",
